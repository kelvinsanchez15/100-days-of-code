### R2D5
One day of fighting hard against Auth in NextJS, I managed to add a JWT token on cookies when logging in but I'm not sure how to query the API with that cookie.

### R2D6
I was able to identify my note app issue, SWR keeps making request to the API and it returns 401 errors, but I don't want them to appear in the console, I would like to handle them on my own. Redirecting the user to /login for example.

### R2D20
Today I did some tests putting together NextJS, Prisma, Postgres and NextAuth.

I need to read Prisma documentation more calmly, so that will be tomorrow task.

### R2D21
I kept working on PostgreSQL basics.

So much to avoid doing my own migrations, but at the end Prisma "forced" me to do it because there's a bug on cascade deletions.

### R2D22
I followed the first hour of the PostgreSQL tutorial from @AmigosCode I plan to continue tomorrow.

Also designed a basic schema with users/post/comments relations to practice CRUD operations.

### R2D23
- [x] PostgreSQL lessons
- [x] Set custom .env variable config for Prisma
- [x] Deploy of CRUD example on Vercel

At the end of the day I had a problem with a serverless function, I spent a lot of time looking for a solution. Turns out the function was fine, I was fetching 'localhost'.

### R2D24
I was able to perform some tasks, but got really tired fixing a problem with an 'undeletable' folder. 

After an intense search I found that it was a VS Code extension that generated the problem.

I opened an issue in case it might be of help to others.

### R2D25
I finished doing integration tests with Prisma and started working on my next portfolio project.

I'm glad to know that the issue I reported yesterday was fixed today and helped at least one person.

### R2D26

- [x] Create custom MUI dark theme
- [x] Make components for: Main navbar, Project navbar, Filters, Issues subheader & Issues list

I am revisiting my Issue Tracker project, this time I will use React and implement new features.

I decided to start with the front-end this time using a JSON response from GitHub API as dummy data.

### R2D27
- [x] Start working in database model
- [x] Add and set Prisma + Next-Auth
- [x] Create withSession HOC
- [x] Update navbar to use OAuth data

### R2D28
1. Add new SQL migration
2. Create API endpoints
3. Test it
4. Repeat

That was my loop today. (Also the usual googling about multifield unique indexes and many to many relations)

### R2D29
I've been doing stunts with NextJS's "catch all" API routes to get all the endpoints I need. I couldn't code in the afternoon because a power outage in my area.

### R2D30
Did an hour of coding and then took the day off to rest and read the recently released Dawnshard novella by Brandon Sanderson. I'm currently halfway there, but I'm loving it so far.

### R2D31
Successful created my first PostgreSQL trigger, I needed a parent based 'number' field and a trigger turned out to be a good fit. Also did some work on a database seeder to ease endpoint testing.

### R2D32

- [x] Make issue/labels m-n relation implicit
- [x] Update issuesList component with database data

### R2D33

I woke up feeling sick with the flu, however I made good progress on an Issue Sorter dropdown component for my project.

### R2D35
I took yesterday to rest and woke up a little better.

Today I worked on the pagination implementation for my Issue Tracker. 

In the near future I have to refactor the code block where I query my database (It became a monster).

### R2D36
Completed the remaining dropdowns and started working on "POST" pages.
I'm struggling with NextAuth because I couldn't find a good way to mutate the session object without refreshing the page or regaining focus

### R2D40
Invested my time migrating some server side rendered pages to use NextJS incremental static regeneration, on static pages you can't access query parameters so I'm using SSR on those who need it.

### R2D41
I made good progress on the components for individual issues, also created an endpoint to be able to do patch and delete actions.

### R2D42
Today I was working on a new logo for a friend's business, as for coding I spent a while making the editable components for my Issue Tracker.

### R2D59
