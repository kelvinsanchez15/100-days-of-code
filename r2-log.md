### R2D5
One day of fighting hard against Auth in NextJS, I managed to add a JWT token on cookies when logging in but I'm not sure how to query the API with that cookie.

### R2D6
I was able to identify my note app issue, SWR keeps making request to the API and it returns 401 errors, but I don't want them to appear in the console, I would like to handle them on my own. Redirecting the user to /login for example.

### R2D20
Today I did some tests putting together NextJS, Prisma, Postgres and NextAuth.

I need to read Prisma documentation more calmly, so that will be tomorrow task.

### R2D21
I kept working on PostgreSQL basics.

So much to avoid doing my own migrations, but at the end Prisma "forced" me to do it because there's a bug on cascade deletions.

### R2D22
I followed the first hour of the PostgreSQL tutorial from @AmigosCode I plan to continue tomorrow.

Also designed a basic schema with users/post/comments relations to practice CRUD operations.

### R2D23
- [x] PostgreSQL lessons
- [x] Set custom .env variable config for Prisma
- [x] Deploy of CRUD example on Vercel

At the end of the day I had a problem with a serverless function, I spent a lot of time looking for a solution. Turns out the function was fine, I was fetching 'localhost'.

### R2D24
I was able to perform some tasks, but got really tired fixing a problem with an 'undeletable' folder. 

After an intense search I found that it was a VS Code extension that generated the problem.

I opened an issue in case it might be of help to others.
