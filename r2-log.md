### R2D5
One day of fighting hard against Auth in NextJS, I managed to add a JWT token on cookies when logging in but I'm not sure how to query the API with that cookie.

### R2D6
I was able to identify my note app issue, SWR keeps making request to the API and it returns 401 errors, but I don't want them to appear in the console, I would like to handle them on my own. Redirecting the user to /login for example.
