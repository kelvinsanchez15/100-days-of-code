### Day 9: July 03, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the basic layout of the Drum Machine project and then I dedicated myself to studying how to implement audios in react.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little sick so tomorrow I will take things easy if I'm not feeling better.

### Day 10: July 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I didn't feel very well so I just did a kata, some research and watched videos about React key events.

**Thoughts:** My plan is to practice on a smaller scale first and then move on with my current project. Health is first tho.

### Day 11: July 05, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Lot of troubles to code today but managed to get some practice with a custom hook that I want to use in my app.

### Day 17: July 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I already started planning how to work on the JavaScript Calculator app, did some research and a little mockup.

**Thoughts:** I hope to keep things simple and not incorporate many extra functions.

### Day 18: July 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the eval() function, just reading about it got me kinda scared. After some testing I think I can make use of it by making some restrictions.

**Thoughts:** I know there are other options, like math.js or implement a shunting-yard algorithm, I'll make the final decision tomorow.

### Day 19: July 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I did some tests with math.js and used regex for input sanitize.

**Thoughts:** I'm having troubles dealing with decimals. I know how to restrict consecutive ones like "5.." but I don't know how to deal with cases like "4.1.2.3"

### Day 20: July 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I couldn't find a suitable solution to make my app's logic work properly.

**Thoughts:** I plan to approach the problem in a different way and make a fresh start.

### Day 21: July 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I had connection problems and limited time but at least I did a couple of katas in Codewars.

**Thoughts:** I already made up my mind that there are days when everything turns out and days when it doesn't.
