# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added "Tweet Quote" functionality, replaced icon to get new quotes and managed to pass the FCC tests.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to have joined #100DaysOfCode Challenge, I'll keep working on the css of my app tomorow 
and I'll try to get rid of some bugs.
