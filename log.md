### Day 9: July 03, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the basic layout of the Drum Machine project and then I dedicated myself to studying how to implement audios in react.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little sick so tomorrow I will take things easy if I'm not feeling better.

### Day 10: July 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I didn't feel very well so I just did a kata, some research and watched videos about React key events.

**Thoughts:** My plan is to practice on a smaller scale first and then move on with my current project. Health is first tho.

### Day 11: July 05, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Lot of troubles to code today but managed to get some practice with a custom hook that I want to use in my app.

**Thoughts:** Between flu and my network connection failing I think I'm progressing slower but hey! Progress is progress!
