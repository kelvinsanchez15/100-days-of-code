# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added "Tweet Quote" functionality, replaced icon to get new quotes and managed to pass the FCC tests.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to have joined #100DaysOfCode Challenge, I'll keep working on the css of my app tomorow 
and try to get rid of some bugs.

### Day 2: June 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Css fixes, style changes, sass refactoring and some improvements thanks to feedback from colleagues on discord.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I want to animate the quote change in my app, although I still don't know how to deal with it in React.
