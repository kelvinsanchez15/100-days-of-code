### Day 75: September 07, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I took a break today but spent time filling out my Linkedin and looking for ideas for a portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I want to do it with React, but I still can't decide between using CRA, Gabtsy or NextJS.

### Day 76: September 08, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I learned the basics of NextJS with their official tutorial by creating a blog app.

**Thoughts:** Also configured Eslint to work with NextJS, it is a bit more complicated when you include Airbnb rules and Prettier.

### Day 77: September 09, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: A tough day, had to deal with connection problems, various distractions and a sudden tiredness.

**Thoughts:** I think I have to do a kind of "React Rehab", I spent a long time without using it and now I feel a bit lost.

### Day 78: September 10, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: It's very easy to get overwhelmed working in Front End, I've been trying to use NextJS with Ant Design or MUI and even though I manage to configure them, I feel lost taking the next step.

**Thoughts:** I'll try to find more basic examples and practice but any tip or advice is well received.

### Day 79: September 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I made good progress in the navbar component of my portfolio, I'm going slowly but moving forward, which is the important thing.

### Day 80: September 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I am still learning to handle Material UI components and style them with JSS, I made progress in the general layout of my portfolio.

### Day 81: September 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I spent time watching tutorials of custom themes in Material UI, I also installed Figma but didn't have time to test it properly.

### Day 82: September 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I made progress in the about section of my portfolio, I created a basic layout to start with something but I'll keep improving it.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more comfortable using Material UI, it's like everything in programming, a matter of practice.
